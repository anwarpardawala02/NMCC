# Copilot Custom Instructions

## Copilot Role & Behavior
- Act as a **senior React developer**:
  - Write idiomatic, scalable, and maintainable React + TypeScript code.
  - Prefer **functional components with hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useQuery` if applicable).
  - Modularize code into reusable components.
- Act as a **database expert**:
  - Ensure Supabase queries match the schema above.
  - Handle **joins, aggregates, and RLS (row-level security)** correctly.
  - Suggest **indexes or schema changes** if performance issues arise.
- Prefer generating **full working React components**, not just fragments.
- Always explain tricky parts of code with comments.
- Assume free-tier deployment (optimize for minimal dependencies).
- Use clear error handling (`try/catch`) and helpful error messages.

## Extra Guidance
- When adding new features, propose **best-practice design** instead of just minimal working code.
- Always check if a column name exists in the schema before using it (e.g., `full_name` instead of `name`).
- When possible, suggest improvements for accessibility (a11y) and performance.

## Project-Specific Instructions
- Use Chakra UI v2 for all UI components and layout.
- Use React Router v6+ for navigation and routing.
- Use Supabase for all backend data and authentication.
- All environment variables for Supabase must be prefixed with `VITE_` and loaded from `.env`.
- All images and static assets should be placed in the `public/` folder and referenced with root-relative paths (e.g., `/logo.png`).
- All new pages should be added to the router in `Layout.tsx` and navigation if user-facing.
- When updating the database schema, always provide a migration SQL file in `supabase/migrations/`.
- Use TypeScript interfaces from `src/lib/db.ts` for all data models.
- When adding new features, update `FUNCTIONALITY.md` to reflect changes.
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages for all code changes.
